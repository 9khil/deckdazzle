Ahhh, chew on this: the ancient Mayans would chew on tree sap for hours to freshen their breath and boost their mood. But it wasn't until the 1800s when the sweet history of bubblegum truly began when Santa Anna introduced chicle, the first natural gum base, to the United States. Now, with the modernization of chewing gum production, we've got gum for days! And not just any gum, but a vast array of flavors and textures to satisfy even the most discerning of taste buds. Don't just chew on any old gum, sink your teeth into the modernized and flavorful world of bubblegum!
